# SBA Kubernetes Cluster
* **Objective** - Create a CI/CD Pipeline that builds an image from github and deploys it to a kubernetes cluster
* **Purpose** - To demonstrate container orchestration skillset



##  Software Used in This Project
*  Git CLI
*  Docker
*  minikube
*  kubectl
*  Python
 * Flask
 * Jenkins

## Instructions
* Fork and clone this project locally.
* Create a respective `requirements.txt` to download any `pip` dependencies for this python project.
  * Ensure you `push` the newly created file: `requirements.txt`
* Create a `Dockerfile` to  build the image.  Push it to github
* Build the image
* Push image to one of your repos on  [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).
* Create a `kubernetes.yml` which will pull the aforementioned Dockerhub image and create 3 running copies of it.
* Use the `kubernetes.yml` to launch your application.  Push this file to your github repo as well.  If possible have jenkins start the app by this method.
* Write and run a script to determine the state of your kubernetes cluster including the information about the services, pods, nodes, ip addresses, etc.
  * upload script to github `kubernetes-cluster-information.sh`
  * run script and  redirect the output of the `kuberenetes-cluster-information.sh` to `kuberenetes-cluster-information-output`
  * push the script output to your github repo
